# Inclusify - Chromophobia & Cognitive Accessibility Extension

A Chrome extension designed to help people with chromophobia (fear of colors) and cognitive disabilities browse the web comfortably by providing color-free viewing options and cognitive accessibility aids.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¨ Chromophobia-Friendly Modes

- **Grayscale**: Converts all colors to pure black and white
- **Monochrome**: Applies a sepia tone effect for a warmer, vintage look
- **Desaturated**: Reduces color intensity while maintaining some color information
- **Saturation, Brightness, Contrast Controls**: Fine-tune the page appearance

### ðŸ§  Cognitive Accessibility (NEW)

- **Big Cursor**: Enlarges the mouse cursor for easier tracking
- **Reading Mask**: Adds a transparent horizontal window with a dimmed overlay to help focus on lines of text
- **Reading Guide**: Shows a colored line that follows the mouse to guide reading
- **Text Size Control**: Slider to increase or decrease text size for better readability

> **Note:** Only these 4 cognitive features are currently supported. All other cognitive features (Bionic Reading, Readability Mode, Focus Mode, Language Simplifier, Hide Distractions, etc.) have been removed for stability and usability.

## Popup Interface

- The extension popup now contains **two panels**:
  - **Chromophobia Controls**: For color filtering and adjustments
  - **Cognitive Accessibility Controls**: For big cursor, reading mask, reading guide, and text size
- Each panel can be enabled/disabled independently
