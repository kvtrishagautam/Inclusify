# Inclusify - Chrome Extension for Accessibility Testing

A Chrome extension that scans web pages for accessibility issues and provides visual overlays with detailed feedback, similar to WebAIM Wave's browser extension.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Real-time DOM scanning** using axe-core for WCAG compliance
- **Visual overlays** with color-coded borders and icons directly on webpage elements
- **Interactive tooltips** showing detailed accessibility information
- **Alt-text suggestions** with confidence scores
- **Interactive element highlighting** for buttons, links, forms, etc.
- **Debounced DOM change detection** to prevent excessive audits
- **Minimizable panel** for non-intrusive use

## Recent Fixes (Latest Update)

### Axe-Core Issues Resolved
- **Fixed "axe is already running" error** by implementing audit queuing and locking mechanisms
- **Prevented multiple simultaneous audits** with proper state management
- **Added debouncing** to DOM change detection to reduce audit frequency
- **Improved error handling** for axe-core initialization and execution
- **Added audit cooldown** (2 seconds minimum between audits)

### Key Improvements
1. **Audit Locking**: Only one audit can run at a time
2. **Request Queuing**: Multiple audit requests are queued and processed sequentially
3. **DOM Change Filtering**: Only meaningful changes trigger audits
4. **Proper Axe Initialization**: Axe-core is configured only once per service instance
